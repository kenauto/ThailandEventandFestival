        Brief: "May brings the start of tourist...",
        Description1: "May brings the start of the tourist low season in Thailand with most destinations generally seeing a drop-off in visitor numbers once the Songkran holiday period is over in April. Hotels and domestic airlines in Thailand often begin to run promotions in May so there are usually some good deals available throughout the month.",

        Description2: "May is still the hot season in Thailand,but increasing amounts of rainfall later in the month signal the gradual transition into the rainy season. That doesn’t mean that you will see relentless rain during your stay, but be prepared for some potentially heavy downpours at any time in May. Temperatures remain hot and during a typical two week stay you can expect to see plenty of blue sky and sunshine mixed in with the showers. Humidity levels are high across the country in May and it’s a month where you are likely to appreciate the air-conditioning in your room more than ever.",

        Brief: "Thailand has unenviable record...",
        Description1: "Thailand has an unenviable record when it comes to road safety. The World Heath Organisation rank Thailand’s roads as the second most lethal in the world after Libya. Despite various safety campaigns over the years, the figures are still shocking. It’s estimated that 24,000 people a year die on Thailand’s roads. Thousands more are injured. Drunk-driving and speeding are major factors. Poor driving standards and a laissez-faire or mai pen rai attitude towards safety regulations are also factors. Selective enforcement of laws by police is another part of the equation. As part of the latest efforts to try and tackle this long-standing problem, the military junta have issued new regulations. Even if you don’t drive in Thailand, the new regulations will affect anyone who travels as a passenger in a car, taxi or bus. The bottom line is, if the road vehicle you are in has a seat-belt, you are legally required to wear it.",

        Description2: "May 5, which previously commemorated Coronation Day, will no longer be a public holiday. The changes were announced last week and take immediate effect. Government offices in Thailand are closed on public holidays so keep these dates in mind if you need to visit a Thai immigration office or other government department. There may also be restrictions in place on alcohol sales on these dates although that may vary depending on the location and venue."
